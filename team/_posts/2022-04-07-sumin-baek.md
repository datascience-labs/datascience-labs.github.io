I have joined the Department of Computer Engineering·Artificial Intelligence at the [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/sites/english/index.do) since Mar.2021.
I have entered the Data Science Reearch Lab[data science lab(DSL)](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/) in February 2022.

The main research of interest are data analysis and predictions, and in my spare time, I enjoy coloring with acrylic paints while listening to music. Currently, I am conducting research because I am interested in energy time series data using data analysis and predictions.
