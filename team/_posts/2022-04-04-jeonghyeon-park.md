I entered the Department of Computer Engineering at  [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/sites/english/index.do)  in March 2018. I joined the Data Science Research Lab in September 2021 and advanced to the master's course in March 2024.  Currently, I focus on carbon-aware cloud computing.  This includes my work as the first author of a paper published in IEEE CLOUD 2024, which proposes a carbon-aware migration methodology to reduce emissions from deep learning workloads. Previously, my research also included site selection methodologies using data mining and graph networks.
