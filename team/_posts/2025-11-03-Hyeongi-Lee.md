I enrolled in the Department of AI at Dong-A University in March 2021. Since November 2025, I have been working (or conducting research) at the Data science Lab.
I am interested in exploring and studying various competitions and projects related to AI and Data. My goal is to become a student who combines specialized knowledge with broad domain expertise.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me by email.
