I joined the Department of Computer Engineering at [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/sites/english/index.do) in March 2021. From July 2021, I started working at [Data science Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/). And I like to look at and study papers from the latest conferences. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us by email.
