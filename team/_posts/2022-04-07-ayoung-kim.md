I transferred to the Department of Computer Engineering at [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/english/Main.do) in March 2021. In March 2025, I entered the master’s program and joined the [Data Science Research Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/). I am currently focusing on research related to table structure recognition and document understanding automation for Korean documents. Previously, I conducted research on digital carbon footprint estimation based on webpage layout complexity.
