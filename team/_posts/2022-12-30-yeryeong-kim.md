I joined the Department of Artificial Intelligence at [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/sites/english/index.do) in March 2021. And in November 2022, [Data Science Research Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/) conducted UI/UX research on semantic annotation. Since June 2023, we are conducting research on campus lecture scheduling through real-time tracking of carbon footprint for net-zero classes.
