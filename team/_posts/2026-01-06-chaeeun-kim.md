I joined the Department of Computer Engineering at [Dong-A University](https://www.donga.ac.kr/kor/Main.do) in March 2021. Since 2026, I have been participating in research as an undergraduate  at the [DSL Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/). 
Recently, I have expanded my interests toward product-oriented PM roles grounded in technical understanding, and I aim to design service architectures that go beyond simple response-based systems by leveraging Agentic AI to enable autonomous decision-making and functional execution.
