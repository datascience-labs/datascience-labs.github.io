## Brief introduction
I have been studying Computer Engineering at Dong-A University since 2022, and have been working as an undergraduate researcher in the Data Science Lab since 2026. I am interested in artificial intelligence, simulation systems, and data-driven applications, and am continuously growing by bridging theory and practice.
