I joined the Department of Computer Engineering at [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/sites/english/index.do) in March 2019. And Since March 2023, I joined [Data Science Research Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/) to study Data Science. Especially I'm interested in Machine Learning and Recommendation system . My hobby is singing & Listening to music. My dream is to go around the world and eat delicious food from all over the world.
